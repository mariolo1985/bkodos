                            process for the calendar from conception to final UI and hand off to development.

                A playbook is a tool found in the OX Sports application. This tool can be used on the computer, tablet, and phone. The function
                of the playbooks in OX Sports is to help coaches create playbooks, edit them, and share playbooks with players
                or other coaches.

                <p>
                    My research for Playbooks was a fun one because I had no real idea what playbooks are and what functionality they would need
                    inside. My research mainly came from my adviser source within OX Sports. They are coaches and have done
                    a lot of research for coaches and the like. They educated me on what they are and provided me with a
                    copy of one to view. They said the main goals for Playbook are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upload and view ready made playbooks from PDF or Powerpoint format.</li>
                    <li>Manipulation of playbooks.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drawing tools</li>
                            <li>Rotation tools</li>
                            <li>Commenting tools</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The viewable progress of players and others of the playbook.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With these in mind, it helped me create a list of requirements for the playbook and what we should be able to do with it.

                    <p>
                        Sketching possible ideas was a fun challenge for this project, there was to be a lot of functionality and I thought how should
                        we lay the workflow out so the coaches can use playbooks intuitively. I sourced some inspiration
                        from Powerpoint since I was told that coaches use Powerpoint most to create the playbooks so there
                        was an easy start to have the playbook be readable and easy to manipulate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along the way I was sure to go back to my coach source for validation of the steps, knowing that they are the end user. With
                        different iterations complete I worked on the Wireframes. Along with the completion of the wireframes,
                        I also introduced prototyping to the mix by hooking the wireframes up to InVision so I can easily
                        translate what playbooks can do for stakeholders and the team. After validation on the wireframes
                        came the completion of the UI.
                    </p>

        <!-- Final UI -->

            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <p>
                    The final UI was relatively easy to complete due to our team creating and updating our style guide and functionality foundations.
                    Using similar patterns from the rest of the application I completed the final UI and shared them in an
                    InVision mockup for stakeholders and the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After any iterations from the feedback, I was then able to create the annotations to the InVision for the dev team. When
                    the annotations are done the project is then sent to 'ready for dev' on Jira for the dev team to grab
                    and work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If for some reason there are questions or a need to speak to talk out a functionality the dev team will relay any questions
                    with Word or we will have a Skype call to discuss any further issues.

                    Playbook was a wild ride, it was one of the first projects I received for OX Sports and one that I dove in head first for.
                    It was rewarding learning about something I had no idea about and listening to the problems that I could
                    solve. It is currently in development and will be debuted soon.
