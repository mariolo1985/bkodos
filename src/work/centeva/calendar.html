                            process for the calendar from conception to final ui and hand off to development.

                The Calendar is a component found in the OX Sports application. This multi-functional tool can be found from the ???web,
                tablet, and phone. The calendar is to help coaches and players organize games, practices, and another events
                in a easy to understand interface that is familiar to the user.

            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    The main research for the Calendar involves looking at popular calendars such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook for
                    competitive analysis. This yielded the look and feel of the Calendar but customized to OX Sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another part of my research was to speak to our Coach Adviser on what the needs are for coaches. He explained there are three
                    main events coaches are concerned about:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Game Day
                        <ul>
                            <li>Day Before</li>
                            <li>Day Of</li>
                            <li>Day After</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With the above information, I began to brainstorm Calendar features and what they should do.

                    The Calendar's look and feel replicated common calendar features to reduce cognitive load. I focused on the event types and
                    the experience of adding an event to the calendar. This includes arranging the inputs in a way that the
                    user would find intuitive.

                    During this phase of the process us as a team were creating the patterns and feel for the overall application, applying those
                    patterns also was in my mind in the design phase. Such as the screen take over models for adding full
                    featured information. This knowledge helped me design my wireframes to be reviewed by stakeholders and
                    our team.
                </div>
                <div class='work-item narrow'>
                    <div class='padding-left md'>
                        <img class='work-item-img' src='/images/centeva/calendar/wireframes.png' />
                    </div>
                </div>

            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Final UI -->
        <div class='work'>
            <div class='work-headline'>Final UI</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <p>
                    This step was probably the most challenging for me. One of our design team members took up the task of finalizing a style
                    guide and design patterns for us to refer to. This would have made it pretty easy to create the final
                    ui, the problem was because he was in the process of finalizing the styles and patterns there were a
                    lot of iteration taking place for the final UI. Sometimes to the point that the final UI would be approved
                    only for a UI pattern or style to change the next day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This part of the process was the most stressful since we were on a deadline to finish these features up and push them to
                    our development team. Also at the time I also needed to complete other sections of the application and
                    the constant change for the final ui would hinder us pretty badly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily we were able to overcome these hurdles by working together as a team and really figuring out what features needed
                    to be completed and how they would look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the design phase for the Calendar I created prototypes through InVision. I believe creating them early really
                    helps you figure out any empty spaces that you are missing in the design. The prototypes were mainly
                    used to show stakeholders and the team how the Calendar worked and if there were any feedback to be able
                    to quickly update them.

                <p>
                    After the UI was finalized and the Prototype complete, it was time to commentate on all the details and functionalities of
                    certain features. This was important because our development team was from overseas and English was not
                    their first language, so getting everything right was also an interesting challenge. Spelling errors
                    were a big no no here due to the fact that they wouldn’t know otherwise, also explaining things in simple
                    terms also was a big priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there were questions they would make a list of them and send it over to us, also we would skype call each other and give
                    the devs a walk through of the application and its functionalities so we can all be on the same page.

                    Calendar was the most challenging application I have designed yet. The simplicity of creating a calendar is cut short when
                    adding the requirements, iterations on those designs, and the final UI challenges I faced during the
                    creation was intense and really helped me as a designer get better and to not be afraid to ask questions
                    and ask for advice. Speaking to the devs was an interesting challenge but a fun one. I really appreciate
                    how everyone came together after all the frustration and dysfunction. I believe it helped our team get
                    closer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calendar has been developed into the OX Sports program and will soon be released.

                <p>
                    There are four main Event Types a Coach can create. Two a Player can create. These event types are the same as the “My Calendars”
                    options of: Season Schedule, Game Prep, Normal, and Private. The two event types that only the Coach
                    can create are the Season Schedule and Game Prep events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Season Schedule Event types are games. For these event types the coach would input all games for the season, these events
                    will transfer over to the Season Schedule section of OX Sports as a listview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game Prep Event types are any event that is tied to a game whether it is before, during, or after the game. It acts as an
                    Itinerary for the players for the games. These will also show up in the Season Schedule section of OX
                    Sports when a user selects a specific game these events will show up as an Itinerary. So any Practices,
                    meetups, or any other event would be filed under this category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normal Event Types are as they are perceived, these events don’t have to be game related both Coaches and Players can create
                    them. An example for a Normal Event would be; Coach Jim would like to have a general meeting with the
                    Offensive Coaching staff, he can create that event in the Normal Type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private Event Types are also for Coaches and Players, these events are for personal events such as: Coach Jim has a Drs.
                    Appointment on the 3rd, he would create that under a Private event, in which ONLY Coach Jim can view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within all four options there are several options that are the same these include: There are four main Event Types a Coach
                    can create. Two a Player can create. These event types are the same as the “My Calendars” options of:
