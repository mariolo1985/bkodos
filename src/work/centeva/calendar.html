                            process for the calendar from conception to final UI and hand off to development.

                The Calendar is a tool found in the OX Sports application. This tool can be used on the computer, tablet, and phone. The
                calendar is to help coaches and players organize games, practices, and another events in a easy to understand
                interface that is familiar to the user.

            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    The research for the Calendar involved looking at popular calendars such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook for competitive
                    analysis. This yielded the look and feel of the Calendar but customized to OX Sports requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another part of my research was to speak to our Coach Adviser on what the needs are for coaches. He explained there are three
                    main events coaches are concerned about:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Game Day
                        <ul>
                            <li>Day Before</li>
                            <li>Day Of</li>
                            <li>Day After</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Practice

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With the above research, I began to brainstorm Calendar features and what they should do.

                    The Calendar's look and feel replicated common calendar features to reduce cognitive load. I focused on the event types and
                    the experience of adding an event to the calendar. This includes arranging the inputs in a way that the
                    user would find intuitive.

                    <p>
                        During this phase of the process, we as a team was creating the patterns and feel for the overall application. Applying those
                        patterns also was in my mind during the design phase, such as the screen take over modals for adding
                        full featured information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This knowledge helped me design my wireframes that were to be reviewed by stakeholders and our team.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class='work-item narrow'>
                    <div class='padding-left md'>
                        <img class='work-item-img' alt='Wireframes' src='/images/centeva/calendar/wireframes.png' />
                    </div>

        <!-- Final UI -->
        <div class='work'>
            <div class='work-headline'>Final UI</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <p>
                    This step was probably the most challenging for me. One of our design team members was finalizing a style guide and design
                    patterns at this stage. While the styleguide and design patterns made it fluid to create the final UI.
                    It caused many iterations to take place for the final UI. Sometimes to a point that the final UI would
                    be approved and to change the next day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This part of the process was the most stressful since we were on a deadline to finish these features up and push them to
                    our development team. Also at the time I needed to complete other sections of the application and the
                    constant change for the final UI would hinder us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to overcome these hurdles by working together as a team and figuring out which features need to be completed
                    and how they would look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the design phase for the Calendar, I created prototypes through InVision. I believe creating them early helps
                    you figure out any empty spaces that you are missing in the design. The prototypes were mainly used to
                    show stakeholders and the team how the Calendar worked. If there were any feedback, we would be able
                    to quickly update them.
                </p>

            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    After the UI was finalized and the prototype complete, it was time to annotate on the details and functionalities of certain
                    features. This was important because our development team was from overseas and English was not their
                    first language. Getting everything right was an interesting challenge. Spelling errors were a big issue
                    due to the fact that they wouldn’t know otherwise. Explaining things in simple terms was a big priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there were questions, they would make a list of them and send it over to us. We would skype call each other and give the
                    devs a walkthrough of the application and its functionalities so we can all be on the same page.

                    The Calendar was the most challenging application I have designed yet. The simplicity of creating a calendar is cut short
                    when adding the requirements, iterations on those designs, and the final UI challenges. These hurdles
                    I faced helped me as a designer and taught me to not be afraid to ask questions and ask for advice. Speaking
                    to the devs was an interesting challenge but a fun one. I really appreciate how everyone came together
                    after all the frustration and dysfunction. I believe it helped our team get closer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Calendar has been developed into the OX Sports program and will soon be released.

                <p>
                    A coach can create four main event types while a player can create two. The two event types that only the coach can create
                    are the Season Schedule and Game Prep events. These event types are the same as the “My Calendars” options;
                    Season Schedule, Game Prep, Normal, and Private.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Season Schedule event types are games. For these event types, the coach would input all games for the season. These events
                        will transfer over to the Season Schedule section of OX Sports as a listview.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Game Prep event types are tied to a game whether it is before, during, or after the game. It acts as an itinerary for the
                        players for the games. These will also show up in the Season Schedule section of OX Sports as an
                        itinerary when a user selects a specific game. So any practices, meetups or any other event would
                        be filed under this category.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Normal event types are as they are perceived, these events don’t have to be game related. Both coaches and players can create
                        them. An example of a Normal event would be
                        <span style='font-weight: 300; text-transform: uppercase; background-color: #F3F3F3;'> Coach Jim would like to have a general meeting with the offensive coaching staff </span>,he can create
                        that event in the Normal Type.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Private Event Types are also for coaches and players. These events are for personal events such as
                        <span style='font-weight: 300; text-transform: uppercase; background-color: #F3F3F3;'> Coach Jim has a doctors appointment on the 3rd </span>, he would create that under a Private event,
