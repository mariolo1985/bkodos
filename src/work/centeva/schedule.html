                            I was the sole designer for this component of OX Sports; with support from my team. I was responsible for the full design
                            process for the calendar from conception to final UI and hand off to development.

                The Season Schedule is a tool found in the OX Sports application. which can be used on the computer, tablet, and phone. The
                function of the season schedule in OX Sports is to help coaches and players plan ahead for games and other
                events that are tied to future games.
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- research -->

            <div class='work-headline'>Research</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    The research for Season Schedule mainly came from our advisers on our team. They set up the requirements with their data
                    for what information should be shown and what features would be important for Coaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They concluded:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Key Information would be; Date/Time, Home/Away, and Opponent.</li>
                    <li>Also, an Itinerary feature would be helpful for Players. </li>
                    <li>Key Information for the Itinerary would be; Date/Time, Location, Title, and Dress.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With this information in hand, I did research for what season schedules look like in general and how we would find a solution
                    for the Itinerary feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My solution was to mainly utilize the calendar for most of the data that is used in the season schedule. To do this we created
                    different event types for the calendar and two of them respond to the season schedule.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Season Schedule Event Type
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are games.</li>
                            <li>Important data to collect are: date/time, opponent, and whether th game is home/away.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Game Prep Event Type
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are events that are specifically tied to a game.</li>
                            <li>An example would be practice.</li>
                            <li>Important data to collect are: date/time, what game, and whether or not there is a dress requirement.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These data sets helped me form the required information needed in the design.

                    <p>
                        For the sketching and wireframes I knew I had to also stay within the confines of the establishing style and function of
                        the new guide, so sketching and wireframing was more simple to create with the requirements that
                        were needed. Having an established way to do lists made it quick to create some wireframes to share
                        stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This phase saw key iterations such as a different view toggle, originally this was included to have a list and a calendar
                        view for the season schedule, some discussion was formed around whether or not we needed the calendar
                        view of the Season Schedule since we have a calendar section in OX Sports. The eventual outcome was
                        to only have a listview for season schedule. If for some reason the user would like to see the season
                        schedule in a calendar view they can easily enter the calendar and select the Season Schedule filter
                        to view all the games.

                <p>
                    After the Wireframes were approved came the UI, again since the style guide was being completed there were a couple iterations
                    from to the final UI. This was a truly interesting time for our team and the project, we never had a
                    defined look for the application so it was a challenge to complete the way the application would look
                    and feel.

                    Using InVision for the prototype. Season schedule was a pretty simple section to design, due to the changes of iterations
                    along the way from multi-views to one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Handing season schedule over to the devs was similar to the other modules the main process was to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annotate the functionality of season schedule for devs.</li>
                    <li>Pass it through Jira to the devs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If the developers had any questions about anything they would send a list of them for us to answer, or if there was any more
                    needed explanation we used Skype to chat with them about the issue.

                    Season Schedule was a fun problem because it was about finding the balance between different sides of the application. Finding
                    out if possibly another part of the application could fill out the data, how to show the data, and what
                    data would be shown was all challenges with season schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My team was a wonderful help as always answering questions or simply getting feedback on ideas was a tremendous help.
