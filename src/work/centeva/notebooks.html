                            I was the sole designer for this component of OX Sports; with support from my team. I was responsible for the full design
                            process for the calendar from conception to final UI and hand off to development.

                A notebook is a tool found in the OX Sports application. This tool can be used on the computer, tablet, and phone. The function
                of the Notebooks in OX Sports is to help coaches and players create notes whether they are personal or shared.

            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    Research for notebook came from seeing what functionality was currently available along with what we could possibly do to
                    create a notebook that would be helpful for a coach and their team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The notebook they had currently didnâ€™t have much in terms of functionality and worked a lot like Mac Notebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Majority of text processors have a way to manipulate the look of the text, how to align them and adding pictures were all
                    standards with them so adding these feature seemed like an obvious choice, also with the work on playbooks
                    we decided adding drawing would be an added benefit.

                    <p>
                        I did some design research by looking at several resources such as the Mac Notebook, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word. I knew
                        I wanted something simple like the Notebook on Mac but also combining the interactively of Google
                        docs also looked appealing. This helped me with my sketching phase trying to piece together all the
                        functionality also by keeping in with the confines of our style and pattern library that was being
                        worked on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the collaborative notes came from Google Docs on how they add people and how the users have a random color depending
                        on the user. The look is similar to Mac Notebook but also keeping with the OX Sports look and functionality
                        of the side nav and the Info Panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This information helped me design our look and feel of notebook for OX Sports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing the wireframes I put them into InVision to share to stakeholders and the group after iterating on feedback
                        I started working on the final UI.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

        <!-- Final UI -->
        <div class='work'>
            <div class='work-headline'>Final UI &amp; Hand Off</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <p>
                    Updating notebook with the final UI was simple at this point of the process, the notebook was one of the last modules we
                    made for OX Sports because of this the look and patterns were already finalized and updating them with
                    the final UI was quick and simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main challenge with the notebook was showing off the different things they could do functionality wise to share with
                    the devs so that they had a good idea of how all the tools work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After updating the InVision prototype with the final UI and getting approval and any feedback from stakeholders and group
                    members I was then in the Annotation phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Annotating any functionality with the best of my ability for the dev team to understand what each feature does and when.
                    After that, I uploaded all the deliverables and link to inVision to Jira moved the Jira task to 'Ready
                    for Dev'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any feedback or questions from the dev team usually came from a Word document. If there was ever any more understanding needed
                    we would have a Skype call with any questions.
                </p>

                    The notebook was also one of my first projects on OX Sports. It was a fun challenge to be given a feature that was already
                    designed and redesign it to the new UI and upgrade the feature set to be more helpful to the users and
                    their problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The notebook will be released with OX Sports.
