                            I was the sole designer for Float Spa 19. Since this was the first project I also took note of the process as a whole so
                            that in the future the process will be easier. Also took note of the time cards for the project
                            for myself and the developer on the project and handled the billing as well for the client.

            <div class='work-info'>
                <p> Float Spa 19 is a spa that specializes in creating a relaxing environment using their float pods. The float
                    pods help individuals float by using salt. Doing this allows clients to relax which lowers stress and
                    helps with balancing the mind, body, and spirit. </p>
                <p>
                    I was tasked with fully designing their website to introduce their brand new spa to potential clients. This was the first
                    big project for MK World Solutions and it was an interesting experience since we had never had experience
                    with project managing before. It was a challenge gathering all the requirements involved, keeping the
                    clients on topic, and gathering their content on time to complete the project.

                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    <p>
                        To receive the requirements for the website we met up with the owners of Float Spa 19 to discuss the needs and wants for
                        their website and getting to know them since we had never met them before. They concluded that the
                        goals for their website were:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To introduce themselves, floating, and other services they provide.</li>
                        <li>To share the location of where their spa is.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Research for Float Spa 19 was an enlightening one due to the fact that in the beginning, I had never heard of Floating before.
                        I utilized Trello in the brainstorming phase of what I knew and didnâ€™t know about floating and what
                        was important for the clients to know before arriving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any information I gathered along the way be it website design research or information research I cataloged them within Trello
                        which helped me quickly go back in forth while sketching or brainstorming ideas.

            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <div class='work-item narrow'>

                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    <p>
                        For this step of the process, I utilized several websites I had saved during my research phase as a base of ideas for the
                        website. I originally thought of doing a one-page site but during the process decided to change it
                        to a multi-page site. This was due to my realizing there was too much information for a one-page
                        site, also since it is a new site one of their main goals was to stand out for google searches and
                        the like. I was advised by my developer that it is better to do multi pages for SEO purposes. For
                        these reasons, I decided on a multi-page website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The website is mainly information based on the goal of having the visitor book online, call or visit the spa. Because of
                        this, I used more pictures, quick descriptions, and easy booking buttons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After meeting up with the clients and getting an approval for the direction I was headed it was now time for the final UI.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Final UI -->
        <div class='work'>
            <div class='work-headline'>Final UI &amp; Hand Off</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <p>
                    This step was one of the most challenging parts of this process, the reason being was gathering all the pieces from the clients.
                    It was new for us to utilize a due date for content and because of this, the process was strained. There
                    was a lot of back and forth from the clients having their copy and content and then confirming their
                    copy and content they wanted to provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the battle for the content raged on I worked on getting a color pallet, utilizing typography, and maintaining cohesiveness
                    within the sections of the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I was finalizing the UI I created a prototype to be able to share the finished project, I also like having prototypes
                    while creating everything so I donâ€™t forget any step or feature with clicking through the prototype.
                    Also showing them to the client was helpful.

                    Through this process, I have learned a great deal about freelance and helping clients with their vision. The utilization
                    of due dates for content is important, we learned due to having the designs on time rather than having
                    repeating updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I greatly appreciate Float Spa 19 for allowing us to create their website it was fun, challenging, and insightful. Exactly
                    what I expect from UX Design in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also couldnâ€™t have done this without my developer partner who helped me bring all of the designs to life and together helping
                    Float Spa 19 succeed into the future.
