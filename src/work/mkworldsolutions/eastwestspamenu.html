                            I designed the Spa Menu for EastWest Spa. I ideated with many options to arrive at the final selection from the client.

                <p>
                    I was approached by the owner of EastWest Spa to redesign their spa menu for clients to easily view. The requirements were:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it to a page.</li>
                    <li>Have all required services and prices listed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With these requirements in mind, I started with the research.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- research -->

            <div class='work-headline'>Research</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <div class='work-item narrow'>
                    <div class='padding-right md'>
                        <img class='work-item-img' alt='Research' src='/images/mk/eastwestmenu/research.png' />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    <p>
                        I started this process a little different than normal thanks to having EastWestâ€™s old Spa Menu. I used their old menu as
                        a starting point for the new menu. I did this by taking note of all the little notes the owner had
                        for the new spa such as different prices or different services. Having the content was a really nice
                        bonus in this case due to knowing the limitations and what categories were needed along with how
                        many options within them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After figuring out the required information, I researched current layouts for spa menus.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Sketching -->
        <div class='work'>
            <div class='work-headline'>Sketching &amp; Wireframes </div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    With the research, I gathered I thought of many wireframe ideas for the layout for the menu. I also started to think of color
                    schemes and what would go well together to help contrast the background with the text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main questions that I worked with in this phase were to either have the menu portrait or landscape. With this in mind,
                    I created several ideas for both to test out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process, I met up with the owner for EastWest Spa to go over potential ideas for layouts. With her help, I
                    decided landscape was a better choice to go due to readability and the ability to house potentially more
                    information.

            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <p>
                    For the final UI I took what critiques the client had for the menu and implemented them in and took her decision for the
                    final look with these in place I was able to create the final product for EastWest Spa.

            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    After this project, I learned how to implement what ideas the client had for the menu and create the visual product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned the difficulties of dealing with the client first hand and the continuous changes that the client had. I learned
                    it is better to state beforehand how many revisions to do before the project ends so that you are not
                    continually revising the final product multiple times.
