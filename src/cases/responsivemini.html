                    Due to only having 2 weeks left of class. As a class, we wanted to have more understanding with several different topics
                    before we graduated. Feeling that 2 weeks wasn't enough time to create personal projects. Our teacher
                    decided he would assign each of us one topic we wanted to learn more about and research and create a
                    responsive minisite and present our topic to our class.
                </p>
                <p> I was given HTML/CSS. It is a topic that has always interested me and one that is increasingly getting more
                    and more popular due to the increasing amount of job titles that seem to require a designer to learn
                    HTML/CSS.
                </p>
                <p> Instead of focusing on teaching the class HTML/CSS I noticed early on in my research that would have been
                    a more futile effort. Instead, I went back to basics and wanted to answer a question that I could go
                    through the UX process with.
                </p>
                <p> The question I came up with was Do UX Designers need to learn how to code? Why or Why not?
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

                <p>
                    At the start of this project, I bought a journal to help me with my decisions. To write about why I made a decision to help
                    with the writing of this case study.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/rms/research.png' />
                <p>
                    I also used other methods to go through my research phase of what do UX Designers need to know about coding, and why or why
                    not should they learn to code. This method helped me keep track of the questions I was asking and helped
                    me to pinpoint what I wanted to research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the research, I had found quite a few posts on the subject. After sifting through all the information I wanted to
                    do some interviews to have a more understanding of the issue.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/rms/research2.png' />
                <p>
                    After figuring out the questions I wanted to ask off I went to find people to interview. Looking back I wish I had also interviewed
                    some of my classmates to have a more of a range of ideas on the subject but unfortunately, I hadn't thought
                    of it at the time.
                </p>
                <p> I interviewed 4 people - 3 UX Designers of varying experience level and 1 Front-end Developer. I recorded
                    them from my phone with their permission and received some valuable information.
                </p>
                <p> All of my UX Designers felt like learning to code would most definitely help in a UX career. Mainly so that
                    communication and workflow could run smooth, due to having the empathy of what the other does. It is
                    an extremely important tool to grasp due to both understanding the limits of design and helping to bridge
                    that gap of trust between Designer and Developer.
                </p>
                <p> This finding helped validate some of the research I had done on the question "Should UX Designers learn to
                    code? and why?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this seemed to point to the fact that UX Designers should learn to code, it made sense anyway a great quote I found
                    on the topic went a little like this

            &quot;Artists have known for centuries that the best work comes from a mastery of the medium in which one works. And our

                While I totally agreed with this statement, I also wanted to see the reverse of the question at hand would be. Thus I started
                researching why shouldn&apos;t a UX Designer learn to code.
            </p>
            <p>
                The research here was limited but clear. Also, my feedback with my interviews also validated the information I found as well.
                The basic clear understanding that both User-Experience Design and any Development are HUGE fields of learning
                both taking years to master and so expecting one to be a proficient in both is just asking that person to
                fail in both of them. Through my research, this quote stood out to me the most on this topic.

            &quot;When someone says they want “designers who can code”, what I hear them saying is that they want a Swiss Army knife.
            The screwdriver, scissors, knife, toothpick and saw. The problem is that a Swiss Army knife doesn’t do anything
            particularly well. You aren’t going to see a carpenter driving screws with that little nub of a screwdriver,
            or a seamstress using those tiny scissors to cut fabric. The Swiss Army knife has tools that work on the most
            basic level, but they would never be considered replacements for the real thing. Worse still, because it tries
            to do so much, it’s not even that great at being a knife.&quot;

            Along with this thought, there was one more point that stood out to me and one that any UX Designer should follow from student
            to pro and that point is to focus first on your own UX process. Understanding the steps, study often on new trends
            of design, follow your process well and with intent, and mostly focus on the user. You are that champion that
            has the users back don't forget it. Understanding your role in the whole process will help make you truly see
            how important you are to the process.

                &quot;I don’t want my designers spending all their time keeping up with the latest cross-browser CSS solutions or learning
                how to use javascript closures. In the same way that I wouldn’t want our developers spending all their time
                diving into color theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want my designers staying up on mobile interface standards and the latest usability best practices. I want them studying
                our users and identifying unmet needs. I want them focused on the work that is going to make our product
                the best that it can be. And yes, part of that work means learning about code, so they can be effective,
                empathetic members of the larger product team.&quot;

            After all of this information and research, I then went back to my project at hand. What should I do for my Mini Site with
            this topic (HTML/CSS) for my class? Well after many thoughts and brainstorming sessions about it, one final point
            that kept coming up was communication. How could I help aid that communication to help with empathy, to help
            with understanding, and trust, to help bridge the gap between Designers and Developers? I thought then of one
            thing, lingo. Vocabulary, that Developers use can sometimes go over Designers heads and block that communication.
            So from there, I decided I would go with a Developer Glossary for Designers.

                <p>
                    For the conclusion, I have to admit, one-page sites can be tricky and really hard to design for because of the blending of
                    different looks and feels. I definitely need more experience in this area but I think overall I believe
                    I thought of a good UX approach to the problem which was do UX Designers need to code. Through the research
                    I learned alot about this topic and thought then how can we help UX Designers and Developers communicate
                    better to create harmony in the workplace.
