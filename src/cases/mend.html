                <p>
                    Every day there are lots of families that have children staying in hospitals being treated for illnesses. Often, for extended
                    amounts of time. Largely these children are taken care of due to the illnesses, although their other
                    family members still have to sleep, eat, and take care of other necessities during this hard time. The
                    main question is what can we do to help these families?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As students at DevMountain in Salt Lake City, my classmate Mike Curtis and I took on the challenge to find a way to help
                    these families, in particular, the parents, during this emotionally and financially stressful time. Below
                    are our design process and the role I played in the creation of our app, MEND.

            <div class='work-info'>
                <h2>Assumptions</h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we came together to understand the issue at hand. Such as figuring out what we do know and what we don't about
                    the situation. Along with some assumptions about the issue at hand.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/mend/research.png' />
                <p>
                    Figuring out the questions we had about helping these families and applying the assumptions into action is where the research
                    began.
                </p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of research on what resources were already available for this issue. We stumbled across this article
                    <a href='http://www.caringvoice.org/2015/03/traveling-treatment/'>http://www.caringvoice.org/2015/03/traveling-treatment/</a>
                    in which discussed exactly that. They listed several organizations that help those in these hard situations, what they do,
                    and why they do them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finding out that there were all of these organizations help solve issues such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing Room &amp; Board</li>
                    <li>Providing Emotional Support</li>
                    <li>Sometimes providing free medical care</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This discovery really helped narrow down Ideas of what we could do. The next step in the process that really helped was the
                    Interviews.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Interviews</h2>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    <h2>Contextual Inquiry Interviews</h2>
                    <p>
                        The interviews provided great insight on how the families felt and what they were going through on a daily basis. As observer
                        and note taker, I was able to really pay attention to body language, take in the environment around
                        affected families, which was extremely important information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interview process quickly taught us two important things:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            They needed motivation throughout their day to keep them going
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They had a lot of things to get done at home, yet had a hard time asking for help
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <p>
                Armed with the knowledge of the research and interviews we were now able to formulate our Main Persona for the app.
            </p>
            <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Persona' src='/images/cases/mend/research3.png' />
            <h2>Creative Brief</h2>
            <p>
                With all this, we had more of an idea of the overall plan of what we wanted to accomplish, and with this knowledge, we were
                able to create our Creative Brief.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        The combination of all of our research helped us come up with an idea, and with that idea, we wanted to map it out. How it
                        would flow, and what the sitemap would look like.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With more and more information figured out now came the fun part. Putting pen to paper we did a series of 10x10 sketches
                        for each screen to help figure out the final design for each screen Mend needs.

                        After choosing the designs we liked we sketched final versions to put in our sketch-book so we can refer to them in the wireframing

                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    A project like Mend really starts to hit home once you see the pieces coming together. We started to develop a style guide
                    for the app, including colors, font choices, grid layouts, and copy for the app. We spent an afternoon
                    sketching out ideas for the Mend logo, and ultimately settled on the logo you see throughout this case
                    study. It utilizes a simple font and subtly embodies the concept of sharing with the three dots in the
                    typical sharing icon positioning.

                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    With our style guide in place, we could begin putting the skin on the app. We chose Android as our development platform and
                    did our best to adhere to Google’s Material Design standards for color, sizing, objects, text, and more.
                    It was undoubtedly a learning process, but we soon realized that within the inherent, restrictive guidelines
                    of Material Design, it also exposed you to a whole lot of freedom, possibilities, and fluidity in design.

                    Conduct Usability Testing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial tests showed an accessibility color issue. Our color scheme had to be tweaked slightly because we wanted to accommodate
                    those with colorblindness.
                </p>
                <h2>Ideate, Refine, Test Again</h2>
                <p>
                    We adjusted some of our screens in Sketch based on the feedback we received and updated our InVision prototype to reflect
                    those changes.
                </p>
                <h2>Design Toolkit</h2>
                <p>
                    With so many resources at our fingertips, we had to pick the best and get moving on the project. I love learning new software!
                    Here’s a full list of the technology we used to complete the app:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adobe Color Wheel </li>
                        <li> Adobe XD</li>
                        <li>Balsamiq</li>
                        <li>InVision</li>
                        <li>Sketch</li>
                        <li>Slack</li>
                        <li>Slickplan Sitemaps</li>
                        <li>Trello</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Project Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    Two powerful insights kept surfacing during the five weeks that we had to complete this project.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            First: We realized that this app could be used for anyone going through a difficult time. Instead of just parents with children
                            in pediatric care, what about families dealing with the loss of a loved one? What about someone
                            who just went through surgery and needs help accomplishing tasks around the house? What about
                            elderly folks? What if you get hurt at work and need some things done around the house? We now
                            realize that the goal of this app is not to be just another to-do app, but to encourage people
                            to create a task, then ask for help in getting them done.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Second: We have become emotionally attached to this project! For me, this happened during the research and interview phase.
                            Sitting down with those moms and listening to their struggles tugged at my heartstrings. I found
                            myself staying up late coming up with ideas and refining our current ones. My commitment to this
                            project was like nothing I had experienced before and this was exciting! I look forward to having
                            a working product in hand that we can hand to these moms, and others across the world, to help
                            them during their most difficult times.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    If UX is about people and solving real-world problems, then this project epitomizes user experience design beautifully. As
                    we move towards the development phase of this project, I hope to soon have a finished, polished product
                    to put into the hands of the moms we interviewed.
                </p>
                <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s no way I could have done this project alone! My team member, Mike Curtis, was awesome through the whole process.
