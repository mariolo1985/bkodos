                    My boyfriend Mario happens to work at Overstock as a web developer and knows plenty of UX Designers and asked around if I
                    could come in and shadow one, I also was able to take part in an actual UX Interview with them as a tester,
                    and was able to ask about what they do and get really good insight in how a real UX Designer’s day to
                    day workings are.

                    So one of the issues users discovered were Log In Issues. It was not intuitive for them initially, and while I understand
                    in most cases when using a site like VRBO logging on and signing up isn’t exactly the first thing you
                    would do, but since the tasks included in the project was for them to log in or sign up it was confusing
                    for them to find the issues. While researching this issue I came across Expedia.com, they simplified
                    the search terms, while also having a “Log In” option on the front as well. Combining research and my
                    own design.
                </div>

            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    One of the main issues Users had was to do with the Search Results. It was so difficult for them to find out their search
                    itinerary and it was hard for them to change any options within the search options instead of going all
                    the way back to the beginning to change the options. It was also hard for the users to Sort the selections
                    due to them not having the intuitive mapping that is needed for such things and finally Users didn’t
                    like how the filter and the search were two different pages, it took them out of an immersive experience
                    and also took away any signifiers that anything from the search results had changed.
                </div>
                <div class='work-item narrow'>
                    <div class='padding-left md'>
                        <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/vrbo/sketching2.png' />
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <div class='work-item narrow'>
                    <div class='padding-right md'>
                        <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/vrbo/sketching3.png' />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    <p> The overwhelming amount of issues came when Users would use the filter option. It came up over, and over
                        again. They couldn’t see which Filters were active, the Terms felt foreign to them, and the overall
                        UI had usability issues for the user.</p>
                    <p>
                        The research for this I wanted to see how other sites created a solution for this issue, and the best one I found was from
                        Hotels.com They created a wonderful way to have the filter and the search results fit on the screen
                        without having two separate options.
                    </p>
                </div>

            </div>
            <div class='work-info clear'>
                <div class='work-item wide'>
                    The last minor issue was found to just be a slight oversight of the user’s everyday expectations. An overwhelming amount
                    of sites now and days create a profile picture as the way to go to their profile. Unfortunately, VRBO’s
                    User picture is not clickable creating a slight frustration for the user.
