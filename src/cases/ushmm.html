                <p>
                    Our class had the great honor of helping the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with redesigning their iOS, and Android
                    app. It has been an extremely rewarding experience, re-learning what the people of the Holocaust had
                    experienced has been such a touching and emotionally charged endeavor but also really helps push me into
                    doing the best I can in every step of the design process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have 8 students in our cohort and we were split into two groups iOS and Android to help in the development of two native
                    apps for the museum, I was placed into the Android group, being that I am the only one in the group who
                    has a history with Material design I was quickly put in more of a leadership role by maintaining the
                    dignity of the Android app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to create a similar app experience to both systems but also to create a distinctive iOS and Android app. While
                    keeping in mind the museum's goals to Empathise, Engage, Act, &amp; Inspire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we started we had a brief about what the museum would like the app to be and who would they like it to be for.
                </p>

        <!-- research -->

            <div class='work-headline'>Research</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info'>
                <p>
                    Our first step for our project was to go over what information the museum would like to accomplish. To do this we created
                    groups of assumptions, app goals, what we do know, what we don't know, app and business goals, then we
                    filled them with things we thought of and ideated on to be able to start researching.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research.png' />
                <p>
                    As a piece of research, we created a survey for our targeted audience to understand what they think about current events.
                    Also instead of asking a good amount about the Holocaust, we wanted to correlate it to their lives so
                    we asked questions about bullying (if they have been, or witnessed others being bullied) It was extremely
                    helpful in the creation of our personas.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research2.png' />
                <p>
                    As a team, we discovered 3 distinct personas we would like to target with our app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our main persona is a student: (14-19)
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research3.png' />
                <p>
                    Our secondary personas include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Millennial (20-35)
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research4.png' />
                <p>
                    Finally, our Tertiary persona is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teachers
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research5.png' />
                <p>
                    From all of this information, we were able to create a vision of what our app should accomplish and was able to then create
                    our brief.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research6.png' />
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research7.png' />
                <p>
                    From our User Story Map we went on to create our User flows, I was tasked with creating our "Get Involved" section.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research8.png' />
                <p>
                    When we all came together the day after creating this we decided that there were too many screens to create and we saw ourselves
                    deal with the very real fear of scope creep. We decided to stop and talk about what we need and what
                    we don't and what can be condensed to create a more manageable app and a more enjoyable experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So because of this, we were able to condense the information into 5 sections: Holocaust Content, Current, Getting Involved,
                    Profile, and Booked Content. With this information, we were able to create our Site Map.
                </p>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Research' src='/images/cases/ushmm/research9.png' />
                <p>
                    With all of this, we moved onto Sketching.
                </p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <!-- Sketching -->
        <div class='work'>
            <div class='work-headline'>Sketching &amp; Wireframes </div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <div class='work-info'>
                <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Sketching' src='/images/cases/ushmm/sketching.png' />
            </div>
            <p>
                We eventually narrowed all of these ideas into a few categories: Holocaust, Current, Impact, Resources, and Profile. We realized
                that the booked content became really overwhelming and something that we weren't sure the users would want,
                we still kept this concept but moved it into the profile section. We also helped break up some Holocaust
                material and Museum info by instead of having the bookmarked section we would have a section called Resources.
            </p>
            <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Sketching' src='/images/cases/ushmm/sketching2.png' />
            <p>
                From there, we decided to split into our two groups and design the wireframes. I was tasked with the Impact section, at that
                point was called User-Generated Content or "UGC". Below are my wireframes and iterations for this section.
            </p>
            <img class='feature-breakdown-img' alt='Sketching' src='/images/cases/ushmm/sketching3.png' />
        </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Final UI -->
        <div class='work'>
            <div class='work-headline'>Final UI &amp; Hand Off</div>
            <div class='work-headline-underline'></div>
            <p>
                After this we all came back together to assign who will create the style guide, I was picked for the Android team and quickly
                went to work with my partner for the iOS team. This step for me was a lot of fun because I was able to learn
                more about symbols both non-nested and nested, implementing Craft libraries and gathering all the information
                the teams would use to help create a cohesive app experience across two different platforms.

            <p>
                With all of these iterations we have come up with our High Fidelity Mockups, below is our onboarding screens for a new user.

                    As a group there were many programs used in creating our final product, some were for organization, and some were tools to
                    help implement and prototype. Here is a list of programs we used in this project.

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was an extremely emotionally charged project. The Holocaust was a terrible situation in history, one I had a
                    painful but meaningful look back on during the process of this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had the most amazing pleasure to help the museum meet its goals. So that they can help educate and inspire the new generation
                    about this time in history and situations here and now that are still experiencing this kind of cruel
                    torture. I truly hope this app will help this generation and next generation find ways to help others
                    and create that empathy for others, helping the world become a better place to live in.
                </p>

                    I would first love to thank the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum for allowing us to take on this redesign for their
                    Android &amp; iOS apps. It was an honor and one I will remember forever.

                    Second, I would love to thank my fellow class members at Dev Mountain. Who helped bring this vision to fruition. I am so
                    grateful to have a teacher and mentor help lead when situations were difficult and helped to create unity
                    with our groups. It was a pleasure to work with all of you and would love to work with you all again
                    in the future.
                </p>
